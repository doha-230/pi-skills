# HTML Report Format

The architectural review is rendered as a single self-contained HTML file in the OS temp directory. It must work offline. Use inline CSS and SVG for diagrams, with no external assets or scripts.

## Header

Repo name, date, and a compact legend: solid box = module, dashed line = seam, red arrow = leakage, thick dark box = deep module. No introduction paragraph. Straight into the candidates.

## Candidate card

The diagrams carry the weight. Prose is sparse, plain, and uses the glossary terms (from the `/codebase-design` skill) without ceremony.

Each candidate is one `<article>`:

- **Title**: short, names the deepening (e.g. "Collapse the Order intake pipeline").
- **Badge row**: recommendation strength (`Strong` = emerald, `Worth exploring` = amber, `Speculative` = slate), plus a tag for the dependency category (`in-process`, `local-substitutable`, `ports & adapters`, `mock`).
- **Files**: compact monospaced list.
- **Before / After diagram**: the centrepiece. Two columns, side by side. See patterns below.
- **Problem**: one sentence. What hurts.
- **Solution**: one sentence. What changes.
- **Wins**: bullets, ≤6 words each. e.g. "Tests hit one interface", "Pricing logic stops leaking", "Delete 4 shallow wrappers".
- **ADR callout** (if applicable): one line in an amber-tinted box.

No paragraphs of explanation. If the diagram needs a paragraph to be understood, redraw the diagram.

## Diagram patterns

Pick the pattern that fits the candidate. Mix them. Don't make every diagram look the same. Variety is part of the point.

### Inline SVG graph (the workhorse for dependencies / call flow)

Use an inline SVG with labelled rectangles and arrows when the point is "X calls Y calls Z, and look at the mess." Colour leakage edges red and the deep module dark. Show "before: 6 round-trips; after: 1" as two labelled diagrams.

```html
<div class="diagram">
  <svg viewBox="0 0 420 220" role="img" aria-label="Order handler calls validator and repository; repository leaks into pricing">
    <rect x="10" y="20" width="110" height="46" rx="6" fill="#f1f5f9" stroke="#64748b"/>
    <text x="20" y="48">OrderHandler</text>
    <rect x="155" y="20" width="120" height="46" rx="6" fill="#f1f5f9" stroke="#64748b"/>
    <text x="165" y="48">OrderValidator</text>
    <path d="M120 43H155" stroke="#64748b" stroke-width="2"/>
    <!-- Add repository and pricing nodes, then label the leakage edge. -->
  </svg>
</div>
```

### Hand-built boxes-and-arrows

Modules as `<div>`s with borders and labels. Arrows as inline SVG `<line>` or `<path>` elements positioned absolutely over a relative container. Reach for this when you want the "after" diagram to feel like one thick-bordered deep module with greyed-out internals.

### Cross-section (good for layered shallowness)

Stack horizontal bands with CSS borders to show layers a call passes through. Before: 6 thin layers each doing nothing. After: 1 thick band labelled with the consolidated responsibility.

### Mass diagram (good for "interface as wide as implementation")

Two rectangles per module: one for interface surface area, one for implementation. Before: interface rectangle is nearly as tall as the implementation rectangle (shallow). After: interface rectangle is short, implementation rectangle is tall (deep).

### Call-graph collapse

Before: a tree of function calls rendered as nested boxes. After: the same tree collapsed into one box, with the now-internal calls shown faded inside it.

## Style guidance

- Lean editorial, not corporate-dashboard. Generous whitespace. Use local system fonts.
- Colour sparingly: one accent (emerald or indigo) plus red for leakage and amber for warnings.
- Keep diagrams ~320px tall so before/after sits comfortably side by side without scrolling.
- Use small uppercase labels with letter spacing for modules inside diagrams, so they read as schematic, not as UI.
- Keep the report static. Inline CSS and SVG are enough; make no network requests.

## Top recommendation section

One larger card. Candidate name, one sentence on why, anchor link to its card. That's it.

## Tone

Plain English, concise, but the architectural nouns and verbs come straight from the `/codebase-design` skill. Concision is not an excuse to drift.

**Use exactly:** module, interface, implementation, depth, deep, shallow, seam, adapter, leverage, locality.

**Never substitute:** component, service, unit (for module) · API, signature (for interface) · boundary (for seam) · layer, wrapper (for module, when you mean module).

**Phrasings that fit the style:**

- "Order intake module is shallow: interface nearly matches the implementation."
- "Pricing leaks across the seam."
- "Deepen: one interface, one place to test."
- "Two adapters justify the seam: HTTP in prod, in-memory in tests."

**Wins bullets** name the gain in glossary terms: *"locality: bugs concentrate in one module"*, *"leverage: one interface, N call sites"*, *"interface shrinks; implementation absorbs the wrappers"*. Don't write *"easier to maintain"* or *"cleaner code"*, because those terms aren't in the glossary and don't earn their place.

No hedging, no throat-clearing, no "it's worth noting that…". If a sentence could be a bullet, make it a bullet. If a bullet could be cut, cut it. If a term isn't in the `/codebase-design` glossary, reach for one that is before inventing a new one.
